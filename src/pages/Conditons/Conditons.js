                                    Learners will initially get classroom instruction (either
                                    physically or virtually). Through Live Classes, Assessments,
                                    Hands on Projects, and other means, they will receive training
                                    on numerous modules. Through our Progress Board, we at Geeks of
                                    Gurukul
                                    continuously monitor the learner’s progress throughout the whole
                                    training session. By evaluating their participation in the
                                    program (attendance of the sessions, both live and recorded),
                                    submissions, and performance on quizzes, exams, assignments, and
                                    projects, we can monitor their progress. To qualify for the
                                    placement training and career services, the students must
                                    maintain a program score of 70 percent.
                                </p><br />

                                    The rationale for eligibility requirements for placement is that
                                    if a learner is not committed to their studies, a successful
                                    placement cannot occur. In our programme, a cutoff score of 70
                                    percent is currently used to determine placement connections. As
                                    we have observed numerous instances of back-to-back interview
                                    rejections without any offer for learners with less than a 70
                                    percent score, attending interviews will be pointless if
                                    standards are not met. To finally get placed, those students had
                                    to go through revision lessons. As a result of the extra time
                                    and effort required, we encourage all of our students to achieve
                                    this 70 percent on their first try.
